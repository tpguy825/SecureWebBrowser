#SecureWeb Browser v1
SecureWeb Browser v1 is a simple, basic internet explorer based browser, that isn't very good. It is perfect for slow/old computers, because it is 256 kb for the whole browser. It doesn't support tabs or keyboard commands, but also uses less than 50mb of ram, 5x less than Chrome.

# SecureWebBrowser v2
SecureWeb Browser (v2 - coming soon) is a fast and secure Chromium based browser.
